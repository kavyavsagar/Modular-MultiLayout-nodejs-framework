# NODEJS - FRAMEWORK


Simple framework with modular structure and multiple layout. The layout can be possible to set based on modules itself. 
This framework is very easy to configure based on different enviorment with minimum effort. 

INSTALLATION
npm install

CONFIGURATION
The configurations are able to set based on the enviornment you are worked in. EG: for development enviornment, you can create seperate file and keep it for that enviornment. So you can create seperate config file for any env you are worked on.

By default, local env is set on config and file is created for it. Add yur config here, config/env/local.js

NOTE :- Detailed documentation will update soon.
